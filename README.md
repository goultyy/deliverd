## deliverd
This is a project aimed to support my "Durham Snus" venture. It is a tracker and courier management system for packages dispatched. Basically, imagine the Royal Mail website. It is like this, but also in the backend includes the ability to:
- assign routes to couriers, and allow them to mark delivered
- add Drops through a secured API
- follow and update status of a package through multiple APIs (these being for different stages of the package's journey)
- etc

Presently open source, using a MySQL backend and Golang to program the API due to it's resilient and low-resource nature.
